# IPC-Using-Parallelization-And-Shared-Memory
This project aims to enhance performance by developing a program that facilitates shared memory updates across multiple processes, leveraging OpenMP for efficient parallelization.

### Features:
- Utilizes shared memory for streamlined inter-process communication, enhancing efficiency.
- Employs OpenMP to parallelize update tasks, improving the overall performance of the program.
- Designed to update a shared memory region containing lines of code, monitoring changes and updating as per specified options.
- Parallelizes the update process, with each process responsible for updating a subset of shared memory data.
- Developed in C++ with the OpenMP library, offering a versatile tool for shared memory update management.
